# bids-examples

This repository contains a set of [BIDS-compatible](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
datasets with **empty raw data files**. These datasets can be useful to:

1. write lightweight software tests
1. serve as an example on how a BIDS dataset can be structured

**ALL RAW DATA FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE EMPTY!**

However for some of the data, the headers containing the metadata are still
intact. This is true for the following datasets:

- `synthetic`
- Most EEG or iEEG data in BrainVision format (e.g., `eeg_matchingpennies`)

# Validator Exceptions

Some datasets may include a custom `.bids-validator-config.json` to ignore errors generated from idiosyncracies of the datasets as they existed on creation.

| name | errors ignored |
| --- | --- |
| genetics_ukbb | SliceTiming values for tasks is larger than given TR, EchoTime1 and EchoTime2 are not provided for any of the phasediff files. |

Other datasets may include a `.SKIP_VALIDATION` file, to skip the validation with the continuous integration service.
This is useful for datasets that *cannot* pass at the moment due to lack of coverage in the [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator).

# Contributing

We are happy to receive contributions in the form of:

- updates to existing examples, or the [dataset index](dataset-index)
- new examples
    - only if they cover aspects that are currently not covered by existing examples
    - only if a maintainer can be found for this dataset
- suggestions on how to improve the bids-examples repository
